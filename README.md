# Project 1: Banana Navigation

## Getting Started

The Environment is in BananaEnvironment.zip. Unzip this to the same folder as the solution notebook before urnning as it contains the environment.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

This Environment stops training and is considered solved with a 100 episode average of +14.

Keep Banana_Windows_x86_64/Banana.exe in the same folder as the project being run.
